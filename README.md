# ai-note-generation
SE 4485.001 Software Engineering Project sponsored by ARGO
This project will create a service that utilizes an existing BHCC Simulator Application, adding an AI feature to generate notes for patients' medical records. A dedicated Note Generation Service that handles all note-related logic will also be created. This service will also expose a RESTful API that allows both manual and automated requests.
